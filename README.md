# 🏦 Bank Management System (C++ - Not OOP)

> This project was created as a **personal practice project** to strengthen my C++ fundamentals, especially in procedural programming and file handling.

A simple **Bank Management System** built in **C++**, focusing on file-based data handling and user permissions.  
This project simulates real bank operations like managing clients, users, deposits, and withdrawals — all through a console interface.

---

## 📋 Features

- 👤 **User login system** with username & password.
- 🔐 **Permission levels** for different types of users.
- 🧾 **Client management** (add, edit, delete, list clients).
- 💵 **Transactions** (deposit, withdraw, check balance).
- 💽 **File-based data storage** (no database required).
- 🧰 **Admin panel** for full system control.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Start the program — login using a valid username and password.
2. Depending on your permission level:
   - You can access client information.
   - Perform transactions.
   - Manage users (if you’re admin).
3. All data is stored and read from `.txt` files.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

This project was built to:
- Strengthen my understanding of **procedural programming** in C++.
- Practice **file I/O** and **data persistence**.
- Understand **authentication systems** and **permissions**.
- Prepare for moving to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** later.

---

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

- **C++**
- **File Handling**
- **Console-based UI**

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Convert the project to **OOP** (Classes: `Client`, `User`, `BankSystem`).
- Add **data encryption** for user credentials.
- Create a **GUI version** using Qt or C#.
